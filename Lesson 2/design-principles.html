            <p class="wordsBelowPic">Hick's Law is all about 
                making sure your site is not overloading people 
                with too many options to click on and not placing 
                a drop-down menu too far away from the origin of 
                being clicked to obtain said menu.  The less 
                stuff, the higher reaction time a user has, 
                and the more comfortable they will be. As 
                you can see in this screen shot, I have 
                the drop-down window pulled down on my 
                phone. All of these choices are simple 
                concise and are really close to the original 
                spot I clicked on to get to the drop-down menu. 
                All of these links are pretty strait forward too. 
                If I click on one, I end up where I want to 
                be on the site within one click. Everything 
                is neatly put and is small so I don't get 
                overloaded trying to navigate the site. 
                This is why I feel the Pokemon website is a 
                prefect example of Hick's Law.</p>

            <p class="wordsBelowPic">White Space, it is super important in 
                Web Design and is really useful when trying to make a 
                page more astatically pleasing to the eye. This Wiki 
                for the game Guild Wars 2, made by ArenaNet the creators 
                of the game, does just that. It utilizes a lot of 
                white space, a lot of breaks from one idea on the 
                page to another. Another thing I noticed and 
                thought was pretty neat is that the site uses 
                a background picture as white space. The picture 
                behind each neatly put square of information counts 
                as whitespace. Because all the ideas are separated 
                by a pretty consistent, small, and noticeable margin. 
                This helps us navigate the site as well. Allowing us 
                the ability to know what is separated and what is 
                connected. This is a really amazing example of white 
                space usage on the web, and I hope to incorporate this 
                similar idea in some of my own projects.</p>

            <h5>Repetition</h5>
            <p>Nintendo</p>
            <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/">Nintendo.com</a>
            <img src="images/nintendo_site_img.jpeg" alt="Nintendo_Site_Photo">
            <p class="wordsBelowPic">Repetition in Web Design is having similar 
                elements keep popping up within a site. The Nintendo website 
                is a perfect example of this because of the red rectangle 
                that appears at the top of the site. This red rectangle, 
                if you scroll through the site, is a common repeating 
                theme through out the web page. As you can see it 
                popping up as links throughout the page, and also 
                as the footer of the page its self. This allows 
                the site to become pleasing to the eye, almost 
                rewarding the eye with something it expects as 
                you scroll down the page.  This is a very powerful 
                way to keep a site nice, and keep it looking 
                organized. Something to note as well, Nintendo 
                did a very nice job at using repetition, but 
                not over using it. They also allowed for space 
                that could be changed and modified when needed. 
                This is why this is a very powerful example of 
                repetition to me.</p>
