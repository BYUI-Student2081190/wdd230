                    <p>Wondering what local activities she could do this weekend with her friends,
                        she did a quick search on her phone. "Local Entertainment in West Jordan Utah",
                        this led her to The Valley of West Jordan's site. Here she quickly learned that
                        the site was about helping people find local entertainment and activities in
                        the Jordan Valley. This helped her find a local movie theater that her friends
                        and her could enjoy saturday evening.
